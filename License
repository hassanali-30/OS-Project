## 📁 `main` vs `dev` – How to Use Branches on GitHub

To follow GitHub best practices:

### 🔹 `main` branch:
- Upload your **final, working version** of the simulator.
- Should include:
  - All `src/` code (working and tested)
  - `README.md`
  - `Report/Final_Report.pdf`
  - `sim_results.txt`

### 🔸 `dev` branch:
- Upload your **work-in-progress** or experiments.
- Use this for:
  - New features (e.g., adding GUI later)
  - Code you're still testing
  - Collaborating with teammates before merging

### 🚀 Uploading Flow (if using Git)

```bash
# Start with main
git checkout -b main
git add .
git commit -m "Upload final working simulator"
git push origin main

# Create and switch to dev
git checkout -b dev
# Make changes, then push to dev
git add .
git commit -m "Testing new feature X"
git push origin dev
